# floating-sidebar

**Theme Summary**

A CSS-based approach to make the fixed sidebar behave like the dropdown sidebar, but still anchored to the left. 

Important in regards to chat:
The chat sections are hidden in the sidebar, and it's assumed you use the drawer version of chat when installing this component. Full-page chat is not readily available, as that would interfere too much with the sidebar in the case the setting `chat separate sidebar mode` is set to fullscreen or always. For the same reason, the toggle button to switch between forum/chat is also hidden.
