# floating-sidebar

**Theme Summary**

A CSS-based approach to make the fixed sidebar behave like the dropdown sidebar, but still anchored to the left. The chat sections are hidden in the sidebar, and it's assumed you use the drawer version of chat when installing this component. Full-page chat is not readily available, as that would interfere too much with the sidebar.
